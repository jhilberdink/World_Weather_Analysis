# world_weather_analysis

This project identifies potential travel destinations based weather preferences and maps a route between four destination cities selected by the user.  The analysis consists of the following files:

- [Weather_Database](Weather_Database/Weather_Database.ipynb) creates a list of cities based on randomly generated longitudes and longitudes and collects local weather data for each city.
- [Vacation Search](Vacation_Search/Vacation_Search.ipynb) allows the user to filter the list of cities based on their weather preferences, and collects the names of nearby hotels.
- Finally, [Vacation Itinerary](Vacation_Itinerary/Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb) plots a travel route between four cities selected from the vacation search.
